# Information
This is simply a copy of the COMS 309 project I did with a team of other persons during my ISU exchange year. The original repo can be (maybe)
found at : https://git.linux.iastate.edu/309Fall2017/VC_B_4_ProjectName
Other contributors to the code are : 
- Alex Nicklaus (nicklaus@iastate.edu)
- Jeremy Chee ( jchee@iastate.edu ) 
- Joe Ward ( jsward@iastate.edu ) 

Code is very messy and might be confusing to look at..
It might not work anymore if the database or server are down.
