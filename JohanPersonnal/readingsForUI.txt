Aesthetics - 
Usability > Fashion
Leave design to people that know how to do it
edu.iastate.coms309.User test the visual design as muc has the behavioral design
Anitipation - 
Give all info and tools for each step
Autonomy - 
Computer, interface, task enviroment all belong to the user. 
Give user breathing room. But not too much freedom
Enable users to make their own decision
Exercicse responsible control
Status mechanism to keep users aware and informed -> feedback
Keep status info up to date and within easy view, ensure it is accurate
Color - 
Give cues outer than color. 
Test it - 
Do not avoid it. 

Consistency : 
1. Top lvl 
- platform consistency - be general and consistend with standards
- in house consistency - maintain a general look & feel across product
3. overall look & feel of a single app. 
4. small visible structures - icons 
Continuity - over time strive for it and not consistency
Default within fields. 
Defaults should be intelligent and responsive
replace the word default with a good term
-> both voc and design must show when a reversion occurs 

Discoverability : 
- do not hide complexity/(if done do so in showroom)
-> if user cant find it, it doesnt exist
- all object necessary for sucess use of soft should be visible at all time
- no exception of elegance.
- (for small device ok) controls do not belong in th emiddle of content area. 

Efficiency - 
Keep the user occupied
Look at the user productivity 
Error message should help

explorable interfaces - 
user should have well marked roads to find their way around interfaces
- make a tutorial ? 
- make actions reversible !!!! 
- give a sense of "home"
- always allow undo/way out 
- make it easy to stay in

Latency reduction - 
when possible use multi-threading to push latency in background. 
reduce the user latency ( visual or oral feedback , trap multiple clicks at the same object))

-keep user informed of delay. 
- make it fast 

Learnability : 
- limit the trade offs
- avoid only testing for learnability 

- Ensure user never lose progress
- txt that must be read should have high contrast 
- use a good font size
- make unique label for buttons and menus

- make navigation visible 
- limit screen counts by using overlay
